A script kiddie is someone who uses pre-existing computer scripts or code to hack into systems without actually understanding how the code works. They are often seen as low-level hackers who rely on the work of more skilled hackers to carry out their attacks. Script kiddies are not true hackers, as they lack the technical knowledge and creativity required to create their own attacks. Instead, they rely on using tools and techniques that have already been developed by others. However, their actions can still be harmful and illegal, as they can cause damage to computer systems and steal sensitive information.
